# 01. About StreamCQL

------
Continuous Query Language (CQL) is a query language used for data streams. Compared with traditional SQL, CQL introduces the concept of window. Data is stored in memory so that in-memory computing can be quickly implemented. CQL query results are computing results at a specific moment of data streams.
CQL is a Storm-based SQL query language. It resolves the problem that original Storm APIs are complex and difficult to use and some basic functions are unavailable. CQL improves usability of the Storm component. 
During CQL syntax design, it is found that syntax of existing CEP products includes not only SQL statements but requires client code. This forces users to learn client APIs, which improves complexity and difficulty. 
The CQL design objective is to use SQL statements and certain commands to execute and release all tasks so that the tasks can be distributed by using SQL interfaces. In this way, client interfaces are unified. Users who are familiar with SQL statements can develop operational CQL programs only by learning certain special CQL syntax, such as syntax of window or stream definitions. This reduces difficulty.
