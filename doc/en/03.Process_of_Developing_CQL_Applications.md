# 03. Process of Developing CQL Applications
CQL application development is different from development by using SQL statements. In the SQL-statement-based development process, data is imported and then queried, and the SQL engine is executed each time when a SQL statement is submitted and obtains a query result. In the process of developing a CQL application, each Submit command indicates completion of an application. One application contains at least one input stream, one output stream, and one data computing statement and can contain customized parameters, files, jar packages, and functions. In the CQL application development process, once the Submit command is run, the system locally compiles and then submits an application. After the application is submitted, all local user operation records are deleted, including configured parameters and submitted user jar packages. When a CQL statement is submitted: if a syntax error occurs, a user can modify the statement and then submit the statement again. If this happens, entered content will be deleted, and the user must re-submit the entire application. Syntax errors usually occur when an explain or submit statement is run. 
The sequence for submitting CQL statements is not strictly specified, but streams (functions, or parameters) must be defined before being used. 
The following table describes the general sequence for compiling a CQL application.
------
|No.	|Operation	|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|1|Add a customized file.|Add a customized jar package. 	Submit the customized file and jar package. This step is necessary only when customized content is used. |
|2|Customize a function.|Define the customized function.This step is necessary only when customized content is used.  |
|3|Create an input stream.|Create an output stream. Create a customized input stream, output stream, serialization and deserialization. 	You can use built-in system functions or customized functions to create input and output streams.|
|4|Compile a logic computing statement.|Use a stream to process service computing logic. |
|5|Submit an application.|Submits an application. |	

The following is a CQL application example:
```sql
--Add a jar package implemented by using a user-customization interface.
add jar "/opt/streaming/example/example.jar";
--Create an input stream by using a user-customization interface. 
CREATE INPUT STREAM S1(C1 STRING, C2 STRING)
SOURCE  "com.huawei.streaming.example.userdefined.operator.input.FileInput"
PROPERTIES ("fileinput.path" =  "/opt/streaming/example/input.txt");
--Create an output stream. 
CREATE OUTPUT STREAM rs(C1 STRING,C2 STRING)
SINK kafkaOutput
PROPERTIES(groupid = "test",topic="ttopic",zookeepers="127.0.0.1:2181");
--Application logic. 
insert into stream rs select * from S1;
--Submits an application. 
submit application force example;
```
> * Note:
Except strings (quoted by single quotation marks or double quotation marks) and application names, other content in a CQL statement are case insensitive, such as key words and parameter names.
