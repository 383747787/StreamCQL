# 02. Key Concepts Definitions

------
- Stream: A set of (infinite) elements, each of which belongs to a same schema. Each element is related to logic time. That is, streams have the tuple and time attributes. Any elements can be expressed in the format of Element<tuple,Time>, in which tuple includes data structures and content, and Time is the logic time of data. 
- Window: A way for processing unbounded and streaming events. A window sets an event stream to a static view at a moment for various query operations on database tables. Two types of window are defined on a stream, that is, time-based and row-based windows. Both types of window support slide and tumble. 
- Expression: A set of symbols and operators. The CQL parsing engine processes an expression to obtain single values. A simple expression can be a constant, variable, or function. Two or more simple expressions can be combined as a complex expression by using operators.
